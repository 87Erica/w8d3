Overview:

This project functionally demonstrates class hierarchy, polymorphism, and inheritance. The base Shape class provides the foundation for all shapes. All corresponding shapes inherit characteristics from the base shape. Each derived class possesses its own methods to retrieve the color, area and perimeter. 

Create instances of different shapes, providing the following parameters: shape, color, area, perimeter.
Call the methods on the shape instances with a formatted string in the print function.
(i.e. print(f"Circle Area: {circle.calculate_area():.2f}"))
 
To store different shape instances in a list, create a for loop. Their attributes can be displayed using polymorphism.

To run this program:
Import math 

Type in the terminal:
python3 shape.py

Output
The output should display the area, perimeter, and the color of each shape.
